# Text Based Adventure Game

With more people focused on staying home and avoiding public functions and gathering in the time of a pandemic, there is an opportunity that has arisen. This team will attempt to rectify the lack of useful resources for online, tabletop Role Playing Games (RPG) possibilities and will even go as far as to allow for single-player adventures for our text-based adventure inspired by Dungeons and Dragons. Expectations are to create an online dungeon game this is text-based with the capacity for multiplayer and single-player modes that can allow people to learn the rules of Dungeons and Dragons with the possibility of going on their adventure more easily. Target audiences consist of gamers that just want to play a classic game easily. No funding is necessary. This is the change to help newcomers and even gamers that are immunocompromised. The goal is to be all-inclusive and refreshing.
